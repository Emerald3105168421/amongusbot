# amongusbot
I coded a very basic discord bot with some commands built in for a server geared towards Among Us (a popular video game).
Obviously, I replaced all the specific values such as bot token and channel/role IDs with words saying what to put there.
A lot of this is random code from across the internet jumbled into one, and I put some code on top of it, so I am aware it is extremely inconsistent and inefficient.
However, it works, and that's all I really need. Feel free to ask any questions, but to be honest I'm not sure how a lot of this works so I can't guarantee I'll know the answer.
